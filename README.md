# PYNQ-ZU-Vivado-Project
1. PYNQ-ZU provides a command line file to form the Vivado project. However, it can only run at Vivado 2022.1. I share the built project here so that you don't need to build it by yourself.
2. If you want to use it to form a Vitis platform, you need to go to project manager->setting->general and click the Project is a extendable Vitis platform.
